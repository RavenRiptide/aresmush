<div class="jumbotron-tagline">Journey to the magical world of Ea.</div>

The autumn of 1023 is an exciting and challenging time for the intrepid Explorer's Guild, known sometimes as the Illuminated Order, a group led by a mysterious figure known only as the Shrike in their search for ancient and mysterious artifacts of the doomed Kulthian Empire. 

Emblem of Ea is an epic fantasy MUSH set in the original world of Ea, and has existed in various incarnations since 2002. We are in the process of converting to the AresMUSH codebase and to the Pathfinder Second Edition gaming system, and are updating and deepening our theme to expand player options and allow for deeper storytelling and more long-term plots.
