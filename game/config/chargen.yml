    to go forth and RP.  You may want to customize your character profile on the web
    portal.
  arrivals_category: New Arrivals
  prologue_blurb: Your prologue is your character's backstory. This does not need
    to be a novel, but should explain how your character got to where they are now, major
    themes in their life and upbringing, and should tie together their ancestry, heritage,
    background, and class into a cohesive whole.
  demographics_blurb: Demographics record your basic character info.
  desc_blurb: You can set both your main description, visible when people look at
    you, and a short description that shows your character at a glance. Like the
    prologue, this should not be a novel, but should give a general idea of what your
    character looks like.
  groups_blurb: Groups determine your character's affiliations. For now, just put
    `Illuminators`.
  hooks_blurb: RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can
    hook into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character
    has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. Looking
    around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP
    Hooks.
  hooks_required: true
  icon_blurb: Your profile icon appears in scenes and the character gallery to show
    your character at a glance. Providing a profile icon is optional. You can upload
    additional character images once you're approved.
  lastwill_blurb: The fate of idled-out characters is at the game admin's discretion,
    but you can register a preference with your character's 'last will'. You may ask
    to be killed off, or turned into a NPC, or whatever.
  post_approval_message: Please make sure they have a profile image for their log
    icon.
  ranks_blurb: This game does not use ranks.
  registration_blurb: This game requires that players disclose their alts privately
    to game admins. See `help register` for more information.
  rejection_message: Sorry, your character could not be approved at the present time
    for the reasons described below.  Please see %xhhelp app%xn for help making changes
    and resubmitting, and contact the person handling your application if you have
    any questions.

      title: Chargen Commands
      text: You can do chargen either on the web portal (help web portal) or in-game.  They
        both have the same information - it's just a matter of preference.%R%RIf you
        choose to use the in-game chargen, the %xccg%xn command will walk you through
        the necessary steps.%R%RYou can go back and forth through the steps of chargen
        as much as you want using %xccg/next%xn and %xccg/prev%xn.
    app:
      title: App Review
      text: The `app` command is your friend during chargen.  It will alert you to
        things you may have forgotten to set.  %xrred%xn issues will almost certainly
        prevent your character from being approved (like forgetting to set your eye
        color).  %xyYellow%xn issues are warnings; they might actually be OK if it
        fits the character concept.

      title: App Submission
      text: You've completed chargen!  Review your app one more time, and use `app/submit
        [<optional notes>]` to submit your character when ready.  The admins will
        make sure it's a good fit for the game's theme, that your sheet is in line
        with your background, and that you have not minmaxed or "dumpstatted". See
        `help apps` for additional help on the app review process.
