You use all your actions to Strike or

    such as draw a weapon, move so that a target is in reach, and so forth. Your targets are
    determined randomly by the GM. If you have no other viable targets, you target yourself,
    automatically hitting but not scoring a critical hit. If it’s impossible for you to attack or

    also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained
    value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example,
    if you’re hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you’re a 3rd-level character,
    you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit
    Points doesn’t count as taking damage.

  Persistent Damage:

    descr: "Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other
    situations. It appears as “X persistent [type] damage,” where “X” is the amount
    of damage dealt and “[type]” is the damage type. Instead of taking persistent
    damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you

    When you’re turned back into flesh, you have the same number of Hit Points you

    action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action
    you’ve been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made

    - including elixirs and potions - while sickened. You can spend a single action
    retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude save
    against the DC of the effect that made you sickened. On a success, you reduce your

  Slowed:

    your slowed value. Because slowed has its effect at the start of your turn, you
    don’t immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn."

  Stunned:
    short_descr: You are reeling and unable to use your senses.
    descr: "You’ve become senseless. You can’t act while stunned. Stunned usually includes
    a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple
    turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start
    of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce
    your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were
    stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to
    stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to
    use your remaining 2 actions normally. 

Stunned might also have a duration instead
    of a value, such as “stunned for 1 minute.” In this case, you lose all your actions
    for the listed duration. Stunned overrides slowed. If the duration of your stunned
    condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition
    toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the
    beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1
    additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to
    use that turn."

    You take a status penalty equal to this value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based
    checks and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell attack rolls, spell DCs, and

  Unconscious:

    descr: "You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t act. You take a 4
    status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and
    flat-footed conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall prone and drop
    items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM
    determines you’re in a position in which you wouldn’t.

If you’re unconscious because
    you’re dying, you can’t wake up while you have 0 Hit Points. If you are restored to 1
    Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act
    normally on your next turn.

If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying,
    you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how
    long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If
    you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can
    act normally on your next turn. 

If you’re unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point
    (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of
    the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.

- You take damage,
    provided the damage doesn’t reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If
    the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying
    condition as normal.

- You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from
    resting.

- Someone shakes you awake with an Interact action.

- There’s loud noise going
    on around you, though this isn’t automatic. At the start
    of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise’s
    DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed.
    If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses
    their Stealth DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don’t
    allow you to attempt this Perception check.

    you wake up either because you have had a restful night’s sleep or something disrupted that rest."
