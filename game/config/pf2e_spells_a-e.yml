While tapping into the target’s senses, you can’t use your own body’s senses, but you can change back and forth from your body’s senses to the target’s senses using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

    target: up to 50 feet of rope or a nonliving rope-like object
    effect: You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands.' You can give it two commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each time you Sustain the Spell.%r* Bind (attack) The rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target Escapes against your spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)%r* Coil The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.%r* Crawl The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.%r* Knot The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.%r* Loop The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.%r* Tie The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.%r& Undo The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.

    area: 10-foot emanation, which affects you
    duration: sustained up to 1 minute
    effect: You repel all magic from the target area, preventing spells and other magic from functioning. Spells can’t penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells—such as dispel magic—can’t affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn’t suppressed within the field. Spells of a higher level than the *antimagic field* overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field.%rThe field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an *antimagic field*.

When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the Spell, you can roll the orb, moving it up to 10 feet along the ground or the surface of a liquid. You can gain this effect multiple times in the same round by Sustaining the Spell multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn't stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.%r%rThe orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb's path into a space of the creature's choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the orb to the end of the orb's movement. The orb can try to Engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature's space more than once.%r%rA creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles. An engulfed Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free either by Swimming with a successful DC 10 Athletics check or by Escaping against your spell DC. A creature that critically failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to Escape instead of Swim. A freed creature exits the orb's space and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.%r%rWhen the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are automatically released."

    effect: You loop a thought process in the target's mind, forcing it to repeat the same actions over again. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target fails, whatever actions the target uses on its next turn, it must repeat on its following turn. The actions must be repeated in the same order and as close to the same specifics as possible. For example, if the target makes an attack, it must repeat the attack against the same creature, if possible, and if the target moves, it must move the same distance and direction, if possible, on its next turn. %r%rIf the target can't repeat an action, such as Casting a Spell that has been exhausted or needing to target a creature that has died, it can act as it chooses for that action but becomes stupefied 1 until the end of its turn.

You can choose not to detect creatures or effects you're aware have that alignment.%r%rOnly creatures of 6th level or higher—unless divine spellcasters, undead, or beings from the Outer Sphere—have alignment auras.%r%rThe strength of an alignment aura depends on the level of the creature, item, or spell.

    heighten:
      3: You learn the school of magic for the highest-level effect within range that the spell detects. If multiple effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn.
      4: As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-level magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

    effect: You touch an object, and it immediately disassembles itself into its component pieces. The spell fails if the target lacks component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap typically triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and the component pieces become small enough to be hidden under normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell.%r%rWhen the spell ends, the object reassembles itself into its original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise.

    area: 1 cube 20 feet on each side
    range: 30 feet
    duration: sustained up to 1 minute
    save: Reflex
    effect: You create an immobile, invisible prison of sheer force. The cage is a 20-foot cube made of bands of force, each a half inch thick and a half inch apart, that extend to the Ethereal Plane. Each creature in the area where you create the cage must attempt a Reflex save. If such a creature fails, it becomes trapped inside the cage. If it succeeds, it's pushed outside the cage into a space of its choice. If a creature in the area is too big to fit inside the prison, the spell automatically fails.%r%rThe cage has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A creature capable of passing through the space between the bars (typically a Tiny creature) can leave; all others are confined within. Attacks with a weapon too large to fit between the bars can't pass through the cage, and the bars provide standard cover even against attacks that can pass through the gaps. Spells and breath weapons can pass through the cage uninhibited.%r%rForce cage is immune to counteracting effects of its level or lower, but it is automatically destroyed by a *disintegrate* spell of any level, or by contact with a *rod of cancellation* or *sphere of annihilation*.

    effect: You quiet the target's voice, preventing it from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn't prevent the target from talking or providing verbal spell components, but no creature more than 10 feet away can hear its whispers without succeeding at a Perception check against your spell DC, which might interfere with auditory or linguistic effects as well as communication. The spell's duration depends on the target's Fortitude save. After attempting its save, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.%r**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.%r**Success** The duration is 1 round.%r**Failure** The duration is 1 minute.%r**Critical Failure** The duration is 10 minutes.

    effect: "You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one *foresight* spell in effect at a time. Casting *foresight* again ends the previous *foresight*. While *foresight* is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls and isn't flat-footed against undetected creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction:%r%r**Foresight** [reaction] **Trigger** The target of *foresight* defends against a hostile creature or other danger. **Effect** If the hostile creature or danger forces the target to roll dice (a saving throw, for example), the target rolls twice and uses the higher result, and this spell gains the fortune trait. But if the hostile creature or danger is rolling against the target (an attack roll or skill check, for example), that hostile creature or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this spell gains the misfortune trait."

These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.%r**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.%r**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.%r**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage.

  duration: 10 minutes
  effect: You transform your appearance to that of a Small or Medium humanoid, such as a dwarf, elf, goblin, halfling, human, orc, or lizardfolk. You gain the humanoid trait in addition to your other traits while in this form, as well as any trait related to the creature's kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (as the *shrink* spell). This transformation doesn't change your statistics in any way, and you don't gain any special abilities of the humanoid form you assume. You can still wear and use your gear, which changes size (if necessary) to match your new form. If items leave your person, they return to their usual size.%r%r*Humanoid form* grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and you add your level even if you're untrained, but you can't make yourself look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM won't factor in the difference in ancestry when determining the DC of your Deception check. You can Dismiss this spell.
