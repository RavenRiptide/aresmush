# Registering Alts

This game requires that players disclose their alts to game admins. This disclosure is visible only to you, to game admins, and possibly to app staff depending on your game configuration. Games that require disclosure of alts will normally explain the reason for the requirement in their policies. This is entirely separate from the AresMUSH [handles system](https://aresmush.com/handles), and should not be confused in any way with AresCentral.

Each alt must be associated to an email address in order to be approved for play. You must also provide a code word of your choice. This word may be a word or a phrase, may be of any length, and may include any UTF-8-compatible character. You will need to provide your code word to register another character to the same email address, and you will be asked for it to reset your password if you ever lose it and don't have a handle. 

`register <name or email>=<code word>`: Registers the logged in character as a player. <name> can be the name of an existing character on the game, but to register another alt of the same player, you have to provide the code word for that alt.

If you are registering for the first time, <name or email> must be a valid email address.

`alts` will show you which characters are registered to you, and your registered email and code word.

You can also change your email address or code word at any time.

`email <new email>`: Changes your email for all registered alts.
`codeword <new code word>`: Changes your code word for all registered alts.
