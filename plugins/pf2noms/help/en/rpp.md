# Roleplay Points and Perks (RPP)-Related Player Commands

To understand what these commands are for, please refer to [[[rules:rpp|RPP Rules]]] on the wiki.

`rpp`: Shows currently available RPP and total RPP. 
`rpphist` (alias: `listrpp`) Shows the history of RPP received and spent in reverse chronological order. 
Note that this is a paginated command, and you can go back further by specifying a page number. For example, to 
see the third page of the history, you'd type `rpphist3`. 

On AresMUSH, RPP is tracked per player, not per character, so movement of RPP between alts is no longer necessary.
There is just one pool for all alts of a player.
