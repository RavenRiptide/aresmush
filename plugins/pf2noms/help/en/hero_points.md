# Hero Points

This game allows characters to accumulate Hero Points, although the system is slightly altered for a MU* environment from the stat of the same name in the AON PRD. Characters may accumulate Hero Points in one of two ways:

* Fractions of Hero Points are accumulated for every different person in a scene in which you participated. This fraction is higher for open scenes than private ones, and diminishes if a player plays exclusively with a limited set of players.
* Staff may choose to award a Hero Point for an action taken by a character that is pivotal to the story, or goes above and beyond to accomplish the goal.

Your current hero points appear on your sheet, in the top section.

Hero points may be spent to reroll a failed roll, or a player may choose to cash all remaining Hero Points to avoid death in a DC PRP or staff-run plot. See the wiki file on Hero Points for more details.

`hero/spend <reason>` - Spends a Hero Point.
`hero/spendall <reason>` - Spends all remaining Hero Points.

Staff commands:

`hero/add <name>=<reason>` - Grants <name> a Hero Point.
