# Nominating Players

This game offers the option to award XP and treasure for good roleplay. Each player has a limited number of nominations per week that they may give to another player of their choice, subject to limitations on how many may be given to any one other player. These options are all configurable and will vary from game to game.

`nom <character>`: Awards a player a nomination.
`noms`: Shows characters already nominated and number of noms remaining for the week.
