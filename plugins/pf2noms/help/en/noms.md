# Nominating Players

This game offers the option to award XP for good roleplay. Each player has a limited number of nominations per week that they may give to another player of their choice, subject to limitations on how many may be given to any one other player in a given time period. These are configurable options that will vary from game to game.

`nom <character list>`: Awards a player a nomination.
`noms`: Shows characters already nominated and number of noms remaining for the week.

Staffers have noms, too. These are called "DM noms" and are worth a little more. Staff characters may not award ordinary noms.

`dmnom <character list>`: Awards a DM nom to each character in <character list>.
