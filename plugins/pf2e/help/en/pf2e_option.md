# Customizing Character Options

Many options that can be set in chargen require you to choose something specific to which that character option applies. This can be true of specialties, feats, skills, lores, and more. When you attempt to select one of these character options, you will be told that it has a choice. If you get this message, you must either resolve or clear the option choice before you can finish chargen or advancement.

`options`: See what options you have selected that require a further choice.
`options <option name>`: See details on what you need to choose for <option name>, and what your options are.
`option <option name> = <value>`: Choose a suboption for <option name>.
`option/clear <option name>|all`: Clears the need to choose an option, or with the keyword _all_, clears all options.
