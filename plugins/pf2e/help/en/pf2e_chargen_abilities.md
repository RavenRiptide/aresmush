# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Abilities

Now you can start assigning ability boosts to your stats. Some of your stats will have boosts already assigned by one of the properties selected in the previous step, some you will need to choose.

These rules apply to assigning ability boosts:

1. You begin at a score of 10, which represents human average. Many races have an "ability flaw", which means that that score begins at an 8. Each boost increases the score by 2. No score may start play at lower than 8 or higher than 18, and only one score may start play at 18.
2. When you receive multiple ability boosts from a single source, each boost must be applied to a different score. For example, a Lucht character receives from their ancestry ability boosts to Dexterity and Wisdom, and an additional boost to assign as they wish. That additional boost must go into one of the other four stats.
3. Many backgrounds offer a choice of boost, plus a free one. If this is true of your background, it is legal to choose one of the options, and make your open boost the other one. The only requirement is that each boost from a given source go to a different stat, when you are done.

It is recommended that where you have an option of two boosts, you choose that first before you set any unassigned ones.

## Commands

Remember: <ability> is always one of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. See the PRD for more information on what these abilities say about your character, and what they do.

`cg/review`: See what boosts needs to be assigned still. If you see a number, you can assign it to anything. If you see a list, those are your choices.
`sheet`: Review your sheet so far. Not everything will be in place, and that is okay.
`unassigned`: See all the things that still need to be chosen to complete the character.
`boost/set <type>=<ability>`: Assigns a type of boost to <ability>.
`boost/unset <type>=<ability>`: Unassigns that ability for that type only. Does not affect other boost types you may have assigned.
