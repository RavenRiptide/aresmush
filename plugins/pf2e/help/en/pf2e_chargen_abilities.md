# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Abilities

Now you can start assigning ability boosts to your stats. Some of your stats will have boosts already assigned by one of the properties selected above, some you will need to choose.

**_IMPORTANT_**: This game does not allow characters to begin play with any ability above 18, and requires that ability boosts be assigned to a minimum of three different stats. Characters who appear to be minmaxed are likely to be delayed in approval.

`boost/add <stat>`: Applies an open ability boost to <stat>.
`boost/rem <stat>`: Removes an open ability boost from <stat>.
`boost/review`: Reviews what your stats will look like with the boosts you have set now, and shows how many remain to be set.
`boost/commit`: Commits the ability boosts as currently set to your abilities. Once you commit, if you want to change something, you will need to reset and start abilities over.
`boost/reset`: Clears all set boosts and starts ability assignment over from the beginning.

`cg/next` when you are satisfied with your ability boosts.
