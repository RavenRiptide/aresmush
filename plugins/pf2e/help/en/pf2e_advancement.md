# Experience and Advancement in Pathfinder Second Edition

As in most games, Pathfinder Second Edition uses a system of Experience Points (XP) to track character growth and power increases over time. Unlike in D&D and Pathfinder First Edition, Pathfinder Second Edition does not operate on a sliding scale of increasingly large experience point totals needed to advance. Instead, to gain a level, you spend a flat 1000 XP, whether you are 1st level or 30th, and XP rewards remain the same per encounter or plot no matter your level. 

XP rewards per plot are shared publicly on the wiki and may be reviewed there. Your current XP total is listed at the top of your character sheet. 

## Commands

`listxp [<player>]`: View a history of your XP rewards and spends. Those with the _manage_alts_ permission can use the argument to see others' lists. Without it, it will display yours.
