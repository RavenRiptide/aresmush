# Assigning Other Character Details

The `assign` and `unassign` commands will also be used to assign feats, languages, and skills.  You do not have to commit these before proceeding - they may be changed at any time before app submission.

A few points -  

* `cg/review` is still your friend here.  It will show you what is still left to assign, and what you have assigned already.
* Only common languages may be chosen with open language slots at chargen time. Uncommon languages, if you qualify, must be a request to staff.
* You may not choose duplicate skills.
* When assigning feats, you must specify the feat by its full and exact name (case insensitive). If the name isn't right, you will fail the prerequisites check.
