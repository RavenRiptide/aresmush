# Assigning Other Character Options

The `assign` and `unassign` commands will also be used to assign feats, languages, and skills.  You do not have to commit these before proceeding - they may be changed at any time before app submission.

'unassigned': Use this command to see what you still have left to assign.

Remember that `app/review` is still your friend here.
