# Pathfinder 2E - Acting in an Encounter

The map is in another app, and nothing here can see it. So what the map would have told the game -
who you are targeting, that you flank, which range increment they are in, what cover they have - is
said in words, and the game does the arithmetic from there: your check against the target's real
defence, your multiple attack penalty, the target's cover and concealment, and what the outcome does.

Every roll is open: the room sees each roll and what it was against.

## The shape of every command

    +e/<verb> <what>=<who>/<circumstance>/<circumstance>

`<who>` is a combatant's id from `+e/view` - `#3` - or a name only one of them has. What comes after
each `/` is a circumstance.

## Doing things

`+e/act <action>[=<target>][/<circumstance>...]` - Use an action.
    +e/act trip=#3
    +e/act demoralize=#3/unintelligible
    +e/act raise a shield
    +e/act aid=bram/athletics
An action that rolls a check - Trip, Demoralize, Grapple, Feint, Escape, Seek and the rest - rolls it
against the target's defence and says how it went. An action that puts an effect on you - Rage, Take
Cover, a stance - puts you under it. Anything else is announced.

`+e/strike <target>[=<weapon>][/<circumstance>...]` - Strike, with your first equipped weapon or the one
you name (by name or nickname, or an unarmed attack like `fist`). A hit rolls the damage and deals it,
after what the target resists.
    +e/strike #3
    +e/strike #3=longsword/flanking
    +e/strike #4=shortbow/range 2

`+e/cast <spell>[=<target>,<target>...][/rank <n>][/class <class>]` - Cast a spell. It is spent the way
`cast` spends it - a slot, a focus point, a use - and refused if you have none. Add `/focus`,
`/innate` or `/signature` for those kinds of casting. A spell attack rolls against each target's AC;
a save is rolled by each target against your DC, a basic save halving and doubling the damage; and
what an outcome leaves - Fear's frightened, Slow's slowed - is left on them.
    +e/cast fear=#3
    +e/cast fireball=#3,#4,#5/rank 4
    +e/cast heal=#2/actions 2
A spell that can be cast more than one way takes the way you name: `/actions 2` for Heal's two-action
form, which heals more at range, or a word of the variant's name - `/silver` for silver Needle Darts.
A save that is not basic deals what the spell's own text says for each outcome; where it says nothing
about the damage, the room is shown the damage for the GM to settle.

## Circumstances

`flanking` - The target is off-guard to you: -2 AC.
`range <n>` - Which range increment the target is in: -2 for each past the first. Past the sixth, a
ranged attack cannot reach.
`<number>` - The DC, for an action with no target: `+e/act balance/18`.
Anything else is a circumstance the rules may ask about: `unintelligible`, a skill for Aid, a variant
like `stabilize`.

## What happens

A consequence the action states outright happens: a successful Trip knocks the target prone, a
Demoralize leaves them frightened.

    Aria uses Trip on Goblin Warrior #3: Athletics 23 (15 +8) vs Reflex DC 17 - success.
      Goblin Warrior #3 is now Prone.

## Taking it back

Every change in an encounter goes on its history, and the GM can take changes back and put them back,
one at a time. Nothing is rolled again: putting a change back puts back what happened.

`+e/undo` - The GM takes back the last change.
`+e/redo` - The GM puts back the change they last took back. Anything new that happens first ends it.
`+e/history [<encounter id>]` - Every change in the encounter, and where undo and redo stand.

An item used or money paid in an encounter leaves your inventory at once, and is on the history like
anything else: the GM can give it back. Once it has moved on outside the encounter - sold, traded, paid
away - it can no longer be given back as it was, and the GM is told which item.

An encounter's history ends with it: once it has ended, nothing in it can be taken back.

A condition that lasts only a while - Feint's off-guard, Slow's slowed - ends on its own at the right
turn. Frightened eases by one at the end of each of its holder's turns.

`+e/why` - Every modifier of your last roll, and of the defence it was against.

## Your turn

`+e/turn [<who>]` - How many actions you have used this turn, whether your reaction is spent, and what
your next attack's penalty is. Nothing is refused: the GM can always say yes.
When your turn starts you are told what matters: your actions, what you are under and for how long,
persistent damage, and your auras.

`+e/enter <aura>=<target>,<target>` - Who the map shows inside one of your auras. They are put under
what it does, following its own terms for allies and enemies.
`+e/leave <aura>=<target>` - Someone has left it; what it put on them ends.

## Cover and concealment

Cover and concealment are the target's, set on it by the GM or a player the GM has trusted this
encounter. Every attack and check against the target reads them until someone changes them.

`+e/cover <target>=<none|lesser|standard|greater>` - +1, +2 or +4 to AC; standard and greater to a
Reflex save against an area too.
`+e/conceal <target>=<none|concealed|hidden|undetected>` - An attack against it rolls a flat check
first: DC 5 concealed, DC 11 hidden or undetected. Against an undetected target, the GM says whether
you guessed its square.

Concealment is set on the target for everyone, where the rules make it a matter of who is looking: a
creature hidden from one character can be in plain sight of another who has darkvision. When that
matters, leave the target's concealment unset and let the one it is hidden from say so for their own
attack - the GM or a trusted player can add `/hidden` to a single roll.

## For the GM

`+e/trust <name>`, `+e/untrust <name>` - Who may set cover and concealment. Trust lasts the encounter.
`+e/as <combatant>=<act|strike|cast|enter|leave> <what>` - Act for a creature, or anyone in the
encounter, with the same commands:
    +e/as #3=strike aria
    +e/as #3=strike aria=shortbow/range 2
    +e/as #5=act demoralize=aria
    +e/as #6=cast fear=aria
A creature's own abilities are used by name: `+e/as #3=act goblin scuttle`. Its abilities' rules
apply by themselves - a bonus to its saves, extra damage on a Strike, fast healing, an aura to place
with `+e/as #3=enter <aura>=<ids>`.

Where a creature's Strike lists Grab, Knockdown or Push, a hit says so and names the command:
`+e/as #3=act knockdown=#1`. Each is a Grapple, Trip or Shove of its own that neither takes nor adds
to the multiple attack penalty; the Improved form is a free action.

`+e/option <combatant>=<option>[/on|off|default]` - A circumstance a creature's own rules declare, such
as Air Scamp's fast healing only in open air. Each is on until you switch it off. With no option
named, lists them.
A creature's turn reminder, and its hit points after it is hurt, go to you alone.
