# Feats

Feats in Pathfinder are special abilities that are tied to a character's development and offer customization of a character's abilities. They can be gained as a character gains levels, and a few are available at chargen. There are a _lot_ of them, and no character will qualify for every feat available.

These commands can be used to review the feats you have or determine which ones you qualify for.

`feat/info [<character name>]`: Shows details for all feats <character name> currently possesses. If <character name> is omitted, it will show the details for all of your feats.
`feat <name>`: Shows details for the named feat.
`feat/options <type>`: Usable only in chargen. Shows all feats for which the character qualifies but does not yet have.
`feat/qualify`: Shows all feats for which the character qualifies but does not yet have.
