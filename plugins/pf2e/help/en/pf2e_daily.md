# Daily Preparation Commands

These commands manage daily preparation code. Please note that daily refresh can only be run once every 24 hours. If you need to refresh more often (e.g. for a plot), you'll need to contact staff.

`rest`: Performs a manual daily reset of spells, condition recovery attempts, HP, and other items prepared during daily preparations.
`autorest`: Toggles automatic daily refresh. If set to ON, automatic daily refresh will be performed at 7 AM server time.

## Staff Command

This command may only be run by game admins.

`refresh <character>`: Removes the refresh timer from <character> and allows them to refresh again.
