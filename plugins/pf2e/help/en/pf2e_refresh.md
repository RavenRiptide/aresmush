# Daily Preparations

(verbiage about daily preparations)

The `rest` command can be run only once every 24 hours. To run more often than that, you will need to reach out to a game admin to refresh you.

## Player Commands

`rest`: Runs the code to implement anything handled by daily preparations, e.g. resource refresh, daily healing, and so forth.

## Admin Commands
`refresh <char>`: Resets the code timer for `<character>` so that they may rest.
