# Roll Aliases

Some characters may have special abilities that add fixed or variable numbers to their rolls, or may simply remember things in a unusual way. All approved characters may establish _roll aliases_ - keywords that represent fixed values to use when rolling dice. These aliases are only useful to the alt on which they are stored.

`roll/alias <alias> = <value>` - Creates or changes an alias. Note that if you name an alias the same as one you already have, you'll overwrite the previous value. (Alias: rollalias)
`roll/alias <value>` - Removes that alias from the list. (Alias: remalias <value>)
`roll/listalias` - Views your existing aliases. (Alias: listalias, rollalias)
