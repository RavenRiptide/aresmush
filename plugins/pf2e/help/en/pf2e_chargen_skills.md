# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Skills and Lores

Next, choose your open skills. Your choice of ancestry, heritage, character class, and background will have offered you a set of base skills. Things to remember:

1. Some backgrounds will offer a choice of skills. You may want to make this selection before you assign your open skills, so that you do not duplicate skills.
2. If you get the same skill from multiple sources, you will still only be trained in it at chargen. Instead, you will be able to select another open skill to replace the duplicate.
3. Lores (knowledges) count towards your skills pool, but will be chosen separately (see below).

## Commands
