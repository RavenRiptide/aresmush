# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Feats

Next, choose your open feats. Feats in Pathfinder are special abilities that are tied to a character's development and offer customization of a character's abilities. Your choice of ancestry, heritage, character class, and background will have offered you a set of base feats. Things to remember:

1. Some backgrounds will offer a choice of feats. You may want to make this selection before you assign your open feats, so that you do not duplicate feats.
2. If you get the same feat from multiple sources, you will need to contact staff to work out how to assign duplicate feats.

## Commands

`cg/review`: Lists the base feats you have available to you.
`unassigned`: Lists what is left for you to assign, based on your base info.
`feat <name>`: Lists details of a feat.
`feat/set <type>=<feat>`: Sets an open feat.
`feat/choose <type>=<feat>`: If you have a choice of feats from <type> source, select which one you want.
`feat/unset <type>=<feat>`: Deletes a feat selected with feat/set. You cannot delete feats granted by your base info.
`feat/clear`: Clears all feat choices.
`sheet`: Shows your sheet so far.
