# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Basics and Ability Scores

`cg/start`: Starts chargen. This command should only ever be used once.

Once you have done that, these commands will set the base information about your character that will drive ability selections and your final ability scores. 

`cg/ancestry <ancestry>`: Choose your ancestry. 
`cg/class <class>`: Choose your class.
`cg/background <background>`: Choose your background. (Shortcut: cg/bg)
`cg/heritage <heritage>`: Choose your heritage.
`cg/specialize <specialization>`: Some classes have specializations. If yours does, choose it with this command.

Some classes will also require that you choose your deity at this time, and any class can if they want to.

`deity <deity>`: Choose your deity. 

Refer to the game web portal for information on what ancestries, heritages, classes, deities, and backgrounds are available on the game.

Setting the above sets the stage for you to direct your ability scores. 

`cg/ability <list of abilities>`: Choose which stats get an ability boost.
`cg/classabil <ability>`: Choose your secondary class ability boost.
`cg/bgabil <ability>`: Choose your background ability boost.
`ancestry/abil <ability>`: Choose free ancestry ability boost.
