# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Basics and Ability Scores

The first thing you'll need to do is set your basic character information. You will only be able to use this command in chargen, and nothing you set here can be changed after approval. To set a property:

`cg/set <element> = <value>`: Sets basic character information.

<element> may be one of:

* ancestry: Genetic racial traits. Choose this before choosing heritage.
* background: Your character's life before they became an adventurer.
* class: Your character's class, their field of expertise.
* heritage: A subset of ancestry, determines what ancestry feats are available.
* specialty: Some classes have specialties. If yours does, choose it using this element.

Once all of these are set, you'll be able to set your ability boosts. Some of these may already be chosen for you, depending on what you selected above. Others will be open.

Remember: No stat may start above an 18, and you must place your ability boosts into a minimum of three different stats. Failing to adhere to this will delay your app approval.

`ability/boost <stat>`: Applies an open ability boost to <stat>.

Once those are set, type `cg/next` to continue to the next stage.
