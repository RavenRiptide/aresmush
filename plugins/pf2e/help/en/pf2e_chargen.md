# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Basic Character Information

The first thing you'll need to do is set your basic character information. You will only be able to use this command in chargen, and nothing you set here can be changed after approval. To set a property:

`cg/set <element> = <value>`: Sets basic character information.

<element> may be one of:

* ancestry: Genetic racial traits. Choose this before choosing heritage.
* background: Your character's life before they became an adventurer.
* class: Your character's class, their field of expertise.
* heritage: A subset of ancestry, determines what ancestry feats are available.
* lineage: Some heritages offer optional lineage feats. If yours does, choose it using this element.
* specialty: Some classes have specialties. If yours does, choose it using this element.

**NOTE**: Resetting any of these options later in chargen will reset your ability boosts, skills, feats, and spells. We recommend that you be satisfied with your options here before moving on.

Once those are set, type `cg/next` to continue to the next stage.
