  # One check: what is being rolled, against what, and how it went.
  #
  # Every figure up to now was a number on a sheet. A roll is not a figure, and three kinds of rule
  # element in Foundry's data attach to the roll rather than the figure - a note shown with it, a rule
  # that turns a failure into a success, a circumstance declared for its duration. None can be read
  # without something to attach to.
  #
  # It also supplies circumstances nothing else can. Deafened's own rule is predicated on
  # `check:type:skill` and `check:statistic:base:perception`, because it penalises an auditory skill
  # check and a Perception check rather than every check - and those are facts about the roll.
