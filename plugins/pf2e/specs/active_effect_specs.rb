  # Nothing modelled one: a spell cast spent its slot and applied nothing, and a condition's `duration`
  # was written by nothing and read by nothing. An effect is now a catalogue entry imported from
  # Foundry's effect packs - its rules read the same way a feat's are - and an instance on the character
  # that keeps time with the encounter it began in.
