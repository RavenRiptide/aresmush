  # What an item does to a figure, from Foundry's own data.
  #
  # Our catalogue used to carry a hand-written `bonus:` hash, and ten of its fifty-one entries granted
  # a conditional bonus unconditionally: Skeleton Key (Greater) gave its +2 to Thievery generally
  # rather than to picking a lock, and Boots of Bounding (Greater) gave +3 Athletics rather than +3 to
  # jumping. The rows are now imported from the pf2e system's equipment packs with their predicates
  # intact, and there is one vocabulary instead of two.
