      # An encounter ending, however it ends: its GM ending it, or its scene stopping.

      # Whatever could not outlast the fight ends with it; so do the turn's counts, what may be used once
      # an encounter, a trust given for this fight, and the cover and concealment set on its combatants.
      # What its characters used of their consumables comes off their own inventories, and what it gave
      # them goes on (`Equipment.settle!`). Its history is frozen from here. Answers what ended, and what
      # could not be settled, as events for whoever tells it.
