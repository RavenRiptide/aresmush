module AresMUSH

  # A creature in an encounter: one goblin warrior of three, with its own hit points and conditions.
  #
  # What the creature is - its defences, Strikes and abilities - is its stat block in the bestiary
  # (`Pf2e::Bestiary`), read by name. This row is only the instance, which is what changes in a fight.
  #
  # It answers to the handful of names the condition and effect code reads off a character -
  # `pf2_conditions`, `pf2_effects`, `pf2_level` - so a creature is frightened, prone or blessed by the
  # same code a character is. Where the engine needs something only one kind of actor has, it asks the
  # actor (`Pf2e::Actors`), which knows which kind it is.
