  # Something a character is under for a while: Heroism's bonus for ten minutes, Rage until the end of
  # the fight, a potion's resistance for an hour.

  # What it does lives in the catalogue (`pf2e_effects.yml`, imported from Foundry's effect packs) and is
  # read the same way a feat's or an item's rules are. This row is only the instance: which effect, at
  # what rank, since when, and how long it has left. It is live state rather than sheet state, so it is
  # never a grant - the ledger records what a player chose, and an effect ends on its own.

    # ending, ends it.
