module AresMUSH

  # A character as they stand in one encounter: what has happened to them there, on top of who they are.
  #
  # The character's own sheet is neutral - level, attributes, feats, equipment, what they have prepared -
  # and carries no damage, conditions, effects or spent resources. Everything an encounter does to them
  # lands here instead, so two encounters never share a wound and `+sheet` always shows the neutral
  # character while `+e/sheet` shows this.
  #
  # It stands in for the character wherever the engine works on "whoever": it answers the names the
  # condition, effect and hit point code reads off a character - `pf2_conditions`, `pf2_effects`, `hp`,
  # `magic` - from its own fields, and anything else from the character. A creature's `Pf2eNpc` does the
  # same for a stat block.
