    # What an attack does when it hits, assembled the way Foundry assembles it.
    #
    # The shape of a damage roll in PF2e is a number of dice of a size, plus a flat amount, per kind of
    # damage, with some kinds kept apart from the rest: persistent damage is rolled again each round,
    # splash damage applies whether or not the attack hit, and precision damage is lost against
    # anything immune to it. Those are `category` on a rule, and they are why this returns a structure
    # rather than one string.
    #
    # Three things the reader it replaced got wrong, all in the same direction:
    #
    #   * A striking rune adds dice, and it was adding both a die *and* a flat bonus of the same size.
    #   * Strength adds to damage for a melee attack, a propulsive one, or a thrown one that is neither
    #     splash nor a bomb (`actor/helpers.ts:420`). It was added to every attack, so a crossbow got
    #     the archer's Strength.
    #   * A Thief rogue adds Dexterity instead of Strength, but only with a finesse weapon. The racket
    #     was read without that condition.
    #
    # `helpers.ts:378` builds the domains, so a rune that says `{item|id}-damage` reaches the weapon it
    # is on and a feat that says `sword-weapon-group-damage` reaches every sword.
