    # `Check` builds what a roll is worth; this throws the die and measures it, the same way for a
    # character and a creature. Everything a rule can do to a roll is asked of the check: fortune rolls
    # twice, Assurance stands in for the die, a keen weapon turns a near miss into a critical hit, and what
    # the roll spent - Guidance's bonus - is spent.
