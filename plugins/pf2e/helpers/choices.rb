    # What a `ChoiceSet` offers the player.
    #
    # A choice set asks a question and other rules on the same feat read the answer: a Charm of Resistance
    # asks which kind of damage it resists and its Resistance rule resists that kind. Ninety-two of the
    # rules on what we stock are questions of this sort.
    #
    # They come in three shapes, and the third is why this is small. A set may list its answers outright.
    # It may name a vocabulary - the skills, the saves, the weapon groups. Or it may describe the answers
    # with a filter, which is a predicate over catalogue entries - and a predicate engine already exists,
    # so the filter is tested the same way every other predicate in this codebase is, against facts built
    # from each candidate.
    #
    # The answer itself is not stored here. A feat's choice is recorded with the feat, which is what
    # `cg/feat` and `advance/feat` write, so a choice taken back goes with the feat that carried it.
