    # What a character shrugs off, and what hurts them more.
    #
    # Immunity, weakness and resistance are the other side of the damage work: damage now has a kind, so
    # something can care what kind it is. Twenty-six rules on the things we stock declare one - a Charm
    # of Resistance, an Aeon Stone, and the immunities Blinded and Deafened carry.
    #
    # The arithmetic is theirs (`system/damage/iwr.ts`) and has three steps in an order that matters:
    #
    #   1. Immunity to the kind takes the whole of it.
    #   2. The **highest** applicable weakness adds its value - once, not once per weakness.
    #   3. The **highest** applicable resistance subtracts, and damage does not go below nothing.
    #
    # Taking the highest rather than the sum is the same shape as modifier stacking, and for the same
    # reason: two resistances of 5 are resistance 5.
