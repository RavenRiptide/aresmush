    # Effects a character or a creature in an encounter is under: applying one, reading it, and ending it.
    #
    # What an effect does is its catalogue entry's rules, read by the same machinery as a feat's, so an
    # effect is one more source in `Effects.sources` and every derived figure picks it up. What this adds
    # is time. An effect has a duration in Foundry's own terms, and it ends in one of three ways:
    #
    #   * by the clock of the encounter it was applied in - a round is a turn of the order, a minute is
    #     ten of them, and the count runs from the turn it began on, which is the caster's
    #   * with the encounter itself, for anything that could not outlast the fight
    #   * at a night's rest, for anything shorter than a day - and a day-long one counts its nights
    #
    # An effect applied outside an encounter has no clock to run on, so it lasts until the next rest or
    # until someone ends it.
