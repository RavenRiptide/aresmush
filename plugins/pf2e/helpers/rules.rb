    # The rule elements we implement, spelled the way Foundry spells them.
    #
    # A feat, an item or a condition carries a `rules:` list, and each row is a rule element: a `key`
    # naming what kind it is, a `selector` naming the domains it reaches, a `value`, and a `predicate`
    # saying when it applies. Those are Foundry's own field names, so a row lifted out of their packs
    # is copied rather than translated - which is the point, since their system is the reference
    # implementation of this game's mechanics and a translation is a place to introduce an error.
    #
    #   rules:
    #     - key: FlatModifier
    #       selector: hp
    #       value: "@actor.level"                # Toughness
    #     - key: FlatModifier
    #       selector: [ cha-based, int-based, wis-based ]
    #       type: status
    #       value: "-@item.badge.value"          # Stupefied, scaled by the condition's own value
    #     - key: DamageDice
    #       selector: strike-damage
    #       diceNumber: 1
    #       dieSize: d6
    #       damageType: fire
    #
    # Foundry ships 42 kinds. A row whose kind is not in the table below is refused rather than
    # ignored: an effect nobody applies is a sheet that is quietly wrong, and the import that wrote
    # these rows refuses the same kinds for the same reason.

      # changes, and their data names ours as well as its own - `resilient`, `armor-check-penalty`,
      # `weapon-potency`. A row that does not say is slugged from whatever carries it.
      #
      # `value` and `diceNumber` are read by `Pf2e::Formula`, `predicate` by `Pf2e::Predicate`. Every
      # other field is taken as it stands.
