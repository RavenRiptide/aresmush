    # The formula language Foundry's pf2e system writes its effects in, read rather than reinvented.
    #
    # An effect says what it is worth as an expression: `@actor.level` for Toughness's hit points,
    # `ternary(gte(@actor.level,17),3,2)` for a rank that improves at 17th. We adopt the grammar so a
    # converted feat carries its formula across as data. Inventing our own shape would mean
    # hand-translating the two thousand formulas their data ships, and a wrong sign or a dropped floor
    # is a number that looks right and is not.
    #
    # Dentaku does the tokenising, the precedence and the tree, and it is taught Foundry's syntax
    # rather than fed a rewritten copy of it. `install!` registers two scanners and asks for
    # case-sensitive identifiers, so `@actor.flags.sneakAttackDamage` and
    # `@actor.system.proficiencies.attacks.advanced-firearms-crossbows.rank` arrive at the parser as
    # single identifiers spelled exactly as the data spells them. A formula string is never edited on
    # its way in, and an identifier is the verbatim source text - which is also what tells a reference
    # from a bare word, since Foundry marks every reference with `@` or braces.
    #
    # `ternary`, `gte` and the rest are Foundry's names for things Dentaku spells differently or not at
    # all, so they are registered as functions. `max` and `min` it already has.
    #
    # Nothing here evaluates Ruby: Dentaku parses arithmetic over a fixed function set, so an
    # expression cannot reach the host, and a function we have not registered is refused rather than
    # guessed at.
    #
    # `formula_specs.rb` holds this against every formula in Foundry's shipped packs, from a corpus in
    # `specs/support/`. That corpus is the guard against having read the grammar wrongly: a construct
    # we misunderstand fails there, loudly, instead of quietly resolving to zero in front of a player.
