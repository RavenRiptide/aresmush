    # An encounter's history: every change in it, which the GM can take back and put back.
    #
    # A change is recorded as the whole encounter before and after it - its order, turn, cover and
    # concealment, each character's state in it, each creature, each effect - so taking one back is
    # putting the before back, whatever the change touched, and putting it back again is putting the after
    # back, with no die rolled twice.
    #
    # What its characters carry is the encounter's own copy (`Equipment`), so it is recorded and put back
    # like anything else, and nothing outside the encounter can move it. The history is one line: `history_at` is how many of its entries are
    # in effect, and recording a new one drops any past that point, which could only have been redone.
    #
    # An ended encounter's history is frozen.
