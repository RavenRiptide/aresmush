    # aura on their allies, Silence on everyone.
    #
    # Foundry's `Aura` (`rule-element/aura.ts`) knows where everyone stands and applies its effects as
    # creatures enter and leave. This engine has no positions, so it cannot know who is inside; what it
    # can know is everything else. `Auras.of` says what auras a character projects and what each would do,
    # and `enter` and `leave` apply and end those effects on someone a DM says is inside or has left -
    # following the aura's own terms for whom it affects. When the aura itself ends, everything it put on
    # anyone ends with it.
