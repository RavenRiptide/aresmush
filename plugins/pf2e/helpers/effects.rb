    # What a feat, an item or a condition does, gathered from whatever carries it.
    #
    # `grants:` already lets a feat declare what it gives you - a further feat, a training slot, a
    # proficiency. `rules:` is the same idea for the numbers: a list of rule elements in Foundry's own
    # vocabulary, described in `Pf2e::Rules`. The thing with the effect carries the effect, so nothing
    # in the engine has to know that Toughness exists.
    #
    # Two roots are available to a formula on a rule, and both are Foundry's. `@actor` is the
    # character - level and attribute modifiers, the facts that cannot themselves be modified without
    # circularity. `@item` is the thing carrying the rule: `@item.badge.value` is a condition's value,
    # which is how Frightened 3 is the same row as Frightened 1, and `@item.level` an item's level.
    #
    # An item may also declare circumstances of its own, with `grants_options:`, taken from its
    # RollOption rules. A Clandestine Cloak predicates its bonuses on `clandestine-cloak` and declares
    # that option itself, so wearing the cloak is enough and a player has nothing to say. What stays
    # conditional is what depends on the player: the action they are taking, or a fact about the check.
