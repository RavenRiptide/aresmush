    # PF2e's bonus arithmetic: a figure is a base plus a list of modifiers, and the modifier's type
    # decides which of them count.
    #
    # The type is the whole reason this is not a sum. Two +1 item bonuses are one +1, because the rules
    # say the highest of a type applies and the rest do not - so a character wearing a ring and under a
    # spell that both grant an item bonus gets the better of the two, not their total.
    #
    # A modifier that does not count is switched off rather than dropped. That is what lets a sheet
    # print "+2 item (ring of protection), +1 item (spell, overridden)" instead of a bare total, and it
    # is the difference between a player being able to check our arithmetic and having to trust it.
