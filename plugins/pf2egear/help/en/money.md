# Pathfinder 2E Inventory - Money and Payment

Pathfinder Second Edition uses a relatively simple money system to track character wealth. Coin denominations are multiples of 10, and the smallest coin is a copper piece or cp. A silver piece (sp) is equivalent to 10 coppers, a gold piece (gp) is equivalent to 10 silvers, and a platinum piece (pp) is equivalent to 10 gold. All prices are expressed in terms of a number of coins and a coin type. Fractions are not used.

## Commands

`money [<target>]`: See your money totals, or if you're a game admin, someone else's money totals by supplying an optional <target>.
`pay <person>=<money> <cointype>`: Pays another character money. Cointype can be: copper / cp, silver / sp, gold / gp, or platinum / pp.

Those with the _take_money_ permission can use a negative number for value to take money from <person>. Usually this is only staffers.
