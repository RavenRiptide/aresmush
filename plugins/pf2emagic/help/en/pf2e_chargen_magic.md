# Managing and Customizing Magic in Character Generation or Advancement

For most classes and ancestries, there isn't a lot to do for magic in character generation or advancement. Your class, ancestry, background, and heritage determine your magic stats, so this is a matter of picking spells for full spellcasting classes. If you need to choose spells, you will be told so in `cg/review`.

`addspell <class>/<level> = <spell name>`: Chooses a spell for that character class and level. 
`addspell <class>/<level> = <old spell>/<new spell>`: Swaps `<old spell>` for `<new spell>` in that class and level. 

All spells selected must be common spells to be selected in character generation or advancement. Uncommon and rare spells require a request to the game admins.
