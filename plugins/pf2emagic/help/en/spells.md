# Magic-Related Commands in Pathfinder 2e
Many characters in Pathfinder 2e have access to magic. This page acts as a reference for magic-related commands.

## Basic Magic Commands
**Commands**:
`spell <spell name>`: Quickly looks up the details of a spell. This command will accept partial matches, but spell details are only given if there is exactly one match. (For a more robust spell search command, see `help spell search` to learn more about the `spell/search` command.)
`magic`: Displays your remaining spell availability since your last `rest` by class, innate spell access, and archetypes. Also displays all focus spell lists. 
`magic <character>`: Displays another character's remaining spell availability since their last rest by class, innate spell access, and archetypes. Also displays all focus spell lists.

## Preparing Spells
If you're a prepared spellcaster, you must prepare spells and `rest` before casting them. For more information about preparing spells and resting and a full list of spell preparation commands, see `help prepare` and `help rest`.

## Learning Spells
If you keep a spellbook (a wizard's spellbook or a witch's familiar) or a book a feat gives you (Esoteric Polymath, Arcane Evolution), you can Learn a Spell to add a common spell of its tradition to it. You roll the tradition's skill (Arcana, Nature, Occultism or Religion) against a DC set by the spell's rank, and pay for the materials:

| Rank | Materials | DC |
|---|---|---|
| Cantrip or 1st | 2 gp | 15 |
| 2nd | 6 gp | 18 |
| 3rd | 16 gp | 20 |
| 4th | 36 gp | 23 |
| 5th | 70 gp | 26 |
| 6th | 140 gp | 28 |
| 7th | 300 gp | 31 |
| 8th | 650 gp | 34 |
| 9th | 1,500 gp | 36 |
| 10th | 7,000 gp | 41 |

You need the full price to try. On a critical success you learn the spell for half the price; on a success, for the full price. On a failure you pay nothing, and on a critical failure you pay half; either way you can't try that spell again until you gain a level. The Magical Shorthand skill feat turns a success into a critical success, and lets you try again after a week. The wizard feat Spellbook Prodigy gives you Magical Shorthand, and turns a critical failure into a failure. Uncommon and rare spells need access from staff.

**Commands**:
`spell/learn <spell name>`: Learns `<spell name>` into your spellbook or book.
`spell/learn <book or class>/<spell name>`: Learns it into the one you name, if you keep more than one.

## Casting Spells
Casting spells depends on what type of spell you'd like to cast. For more information about casting spells and a full list of casting commands, see `help casting`.

## Searching Spells
The `spell/search` command provides a robust search function to help you find spells for your character to learn. See `help spell search` for more information.

To see only the spells you could actually put in a slot - the right tradition, at a rank you can
cast - use `spell/eligible <level>`, or `spell/eligible` on its own to see which traditions you draw on.
