"""Foundry's effects, as a catalogue of things a character can be under for a while.

An effect is what a spell, a feat, an item or a creature leaves behind: Heroism's status bonus for ten
minutes, Rage until the end of the encounter, a potion's resistance for an hour, a creature aura's hold
on whoever stands in it. Each carries rules in the same vocabulary our other catalogues use, and a
duration.

The rules go through `import_foundry_rules.take` - the same gate every other catalogue here was
imported through - so a rule this engine cannot read is refused and counted rather than flattened.
An effect is kept even when none of its rules survive: it is still a thing someone can be under, and a
grant elsewhere may name it.

A grant naming another effect by its compendium id is rewritten to name it, because a name is what
our catalogue is keyed by and what a player types.
