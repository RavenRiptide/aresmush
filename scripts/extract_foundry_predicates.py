"""Every distinct predicate in Foundry's pf2e packs, one per line with its use count.

A predicate is how a rule element says "only in these circumstances": a list of statements
tested against a set of options. Pf2e::Predicate must find every line here structurally
valid - a line it rejects is a construct we have read wrongly, which would otherwise show up
as a bonus that applies when it should not.

Usage: scripts/extract_foundry_predicates.py /path/to/foundryvtt-pf2e
